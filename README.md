# BlogSimple
A blogging website where users can sign up, set up their profile and begin posting blogs. Users may also view other published blogs and choose to comment on those blogs as well as update their about me page and add links to their social media.

Work Process:
The Blog Simple application was developed using ASP.NET with C# using Visual Studio. User data was all stored in MS SQL on Azure with sensitive data and secrets kept in Key Vault. Blog Simple was designed implementing a repository design pattern to provide a loosely coupled approach to data access. This was effective in reducing code redundancy and increased code maintainability and scalability. SendGrid API was used to allow sending of email to the user regarding user registration, email confirmation and password resets.
